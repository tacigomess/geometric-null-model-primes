# Geometric Null Models for Prime Distributions

This repository accompanies the manuscript:

**Residual Spatial Correlations in Geometric Embeddings of Prime Numbers**  
Manuscript in preparation (2026)

## Overview

This project investigates the spatial organization of prime numbers through a continuous geometric embedding of the natural numbers into a logarithmic spiral. Within this geometric representation, we define local prime densities based on Euclidean neighborhoods and analyze their statistical properties across multiple spatial scales.

To assess whether observed local structures can be explained solely by geometric effects and by the average rarefaction of primes, we introduce a **geometric null model inspired by Cramér’s probabilistic model**. In this null configuration, the embedding geometry and global intensity are preserved, while arithmetic correlations are removed via independent Bernoulli sampling.

Comparisons between the real prime distribution and the null model are performed using non-parametric statistical tests, revealing residual spatial correlations at mesoscopic scales.

---

## Scientific goals

- Embed natural numbers and primes in a continuous geometric space
- Define and measure local prime density using spatial neighborhoods
- Construct a calibrated geometric null model of Cramér type
- Compare real and null configurations using distribution-level statistics
- Identify scale-dependent residual spatial correlations

## Experimental Pipeline and Interpretation

This project is organized as a sequence of numbered experiments. 
Each experiment produces well-defined outputs that serve as inputs for subsequent stages. 
Together, they allow a controlled investigation of local spatial structure in the geometric distribution of prime numbers.

### First of all: E1 — Generation of the geometric embedding (base dataset)

### Objective
To construct a continuous geometric embedding of the natural numbers into a logarithmic spiral and to identify the real prime numbers within the analyzed interval. 
This experiment defines the fixed geometric space used throughout the project.


```bash
python E1_generate_log_spiral_dataset_min.py \
  --N 1000000 \
  --b 0.1 \
  --radius_mode adaptive \
  --z_factor 0.1 \
  --block_size 50000 \
  --percentile 95 \
  --out_csv data/E1_base_log_espiral_1M.csv
```

### Output
data/E1_base_log_espiral_1M.csv

-The output directory (/data) is created by the script.

### Typical columns include:

n — natural number

x, y — geometric coordinates

is_prime — arithmetic label (1 if prime, 0 otherwise)

### Interpretation
This experiment fixes the geometry of the problem. Primes and composite numbers share the same embedding. No statistical hypothesis is tested at this stage; the output simply defines the spatial domain in which all subsequent analyses are performed.

Notes

-This dataset is intentionally comprehensive. In addition to the features required for the present work, it also includes auxiliary features originally developed for a previous project on prime density halos. These additional features are not used in the current analysis.

-The same base dataset is reused across subsequent projects, ensuring consistency of the geometric embedding and facilitating comparative studies.

### E2 — Construction of the geometric null model (Cramér-type)

### Objective
To generate a statistically controlled null configuration that preserves geometry and global intensity while removing arithmetic correlations among primes.

### Script
```bash
python generate_null_on_real_embedding.py
```

### Input

Base dataset generated in E1

## Reproducing the results

### 1. Generate the geometric embedding
Embedding generation

The geometric embedding used throughout this work is generated by
E1_generate_log_spiral_dataset_min.py, which implements the logarithmic
spiral mapping described in Section 2.1 of the manuscript.

-The output directory (/data) is created by the script.

```bash
python E1_generate_log_spiral_dataset_min.py \
  --N 1000000 \
  --b 0.1 \
  --radius_mode adaptive \
  --z_factor 0.1 \
  --block_size 50000 \
  --percentile 95 \
  --out_csv data/E1_base_log_espiral_1M.csv
```

This script:
- embeds natural numbers in a logarithmic spiral,
- labels prime numbers,
- saves the result to `data/real_embedding.csv`.

---

### 2. Generate the geometric null model

```bash
python scripts/generate_null_on_real_embedding.py
```

### This script:
- keeps the geometric embedding fixed,
- replaces prime labels with independent Bernoulli events,
- calibrates the normalization constant \( c \),
- saves the null realization to `data/null_on_real_embedding.csv`.

### Input

Base dataset generated in E1

### Probability model
```bash
p(n) = c / log(n)
```

### Output
`data/null_on_real_embedding.csv`

- Typical terminal output:
```bash
Real primes: 78498 | Null events: 78207 | c = 0.9983
```

### Interpretation

The null model:

- uses exactly the same geometric coordinates as the real data,

- matches the total number of events,

- reproduces the large-scale rarefaction of primes,

- removes all arithmetic correlations via independent Bernoulli sampling.

- This experiment defines the main null hypothesis of the study.

---

### 3. Compare local densities (reference scale)

```bash
python scripts/compare_density_on_sampled_points_realembed.py
```

This script:
- samples spatial centers from the full embedding,
- computes local densities for real and null configurations,
- performs Kolmogorov–Smirnov tests,
- generates CDF figures used in the manuscript.

---

### 4. Multi-scale robustness analysis

```bash
python scripts/sweep_radius_density_real_embedding.py
```

This script:
- repeats the density comparison across multiple radii,
- computes KS statistics as a function of scale,
- saves results to `data/radius_sweep_real_embedding.csv`,
- generates the KS × R figure.

## Figures

All figures appearing in the manuscript are generated by scripts in `scripts/` and saved in `figures/`:

- **Figure 1** — Geometric embedding and neighborhood illustration  
- **Figure 2** — Real vs null configuration (same geometry, side by side)  
- **Figure 3** — CDF of local densities at \( R = 10 \)  
- **Figure 3b** — Zoomed CDF with KS statistic highlighted  
- **Figure 4** — KS statistic as a function of neighborhood radius  
- **Supplementary** — KS vs cutoff experiments

---

## Methodological notes

- Local densities are **not evaluated exclusively at prime locations**, in order to avoid autoconditioning bias.
- All comparisons preserve:
  - embedding geometry,
  - global event intensity,
  - large-scale rarefaction.
- Statistical comparisons are performed on full empirical distributions, not only on mean values.
